# CS320
Week 8 submission for CS 320.

**How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure? How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program? How do I approach designing software?**

I can ensure that my code is functional and secure by first programming software to meet any requirements set by a client or project instructions. Then, I can test based on those requirements and also ensure to test cases to test the functionality of the program. To test for the security of the program, I would attempt to find weak points in the software and ensure the software has protections in place to prevent any breach.

User needs can be incorporated into the program by laying the foundation of the code so that it corresponds to the user's needs. For example, ContactService had several character limits that I considered when programming so that those character limits would have to be met. When I design software, I always reference the user's needs so that I can meet all their requirements.
